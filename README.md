- With ubikz the goal was to practice modern ecommerce platform building with advanced webhook based payment gateways and Client Server REST Design using various functionalities such as advanced filtering/sorting/pagination/limiting of products and comprehensive user management using RBA'S/Hashing and many other modern techniques. The authentication module although build back in 2023 is still very comprehensive and reliant for small-medium scale applications along with SMTP Mail integration. The website was overall very helpful for me to learn building complex ecommerce platforms such as Ananya Sales & DM Sales that are a very polished work on the UBIKZ Starter frame.
