- Secure Login/SignUp functionality is added allowing users to signup/login & logout easily from the website
- The STMP Mail system alert users with welcomes, password resets information and other website alerts
- Ubikz follows a modern genZ fashion theme and similar styling to Indian Fast Fashion Brand Bewakoof following a modern color scheme and vibrance
- The website contains an account panel wherein users can review the orders placed on the website
- The comprehensive admin panel allows for the admin/management to add products easily through a comprehensive panel that allows for easy creation/deletion and updating the listed products on the website.
- With ubikz the goal was to practice modern ecommerce platform building with advanced webhook based payment gateways and Client Server REST Design using various functionalities such as advanced filtering/sorting/pagination/limiting of products and comprehensive user management using RBA'S/Hashing and many other modern techniques. The authentication module although build back in 2023 is still very comprehensive and reliant for small-medium scale applications along with SMTP Mail integration. The website was overall very helpful for me to learn building complex ecommerce platforms such as Ananya Sales & DM Sales that are a very polished work on the UBIKZ Starter frame.

The following Readme will guide you further with the project generalized documentation and workflow along with project visuals.

### Architecture Overview
The UBIKZ-fashion-ecommerce repository is a Node.js powered fast fashion brand website that leverages modern web technologies and follows a REST architecture. The architecture is designed to ensure scalability and high performance across thousands of users. The primary languages used are JavaScript,HTML,CSS,PUG TEMPLATE ENGINE and modern Node JS framework & modules. A complete log of all developer dependencies and modules used can be found in package-lock.json file attached to the repo. I would now continue by discussion individual features-

#### 1. HomePage Design
![Homepage complete](./visuals/homepage-layout.png)
*The above homepage design was inspired from Bewakoof fast fashion ecommerce website representing a modern, clean, genz- aesthetic layout that is both minimal and easy to navigate for all users*

#### 2. Authentication
*The project follows a robust,simple,modern and effective easy to integrate authentication system goverened by my custom authController.js file built completely from scratch using modules such as bcrypt for encryption and security. This system was most popular back in 2024 when i built this website from scratch. The complete authentication system can be reviewed by accessing the authController.js file. It allows users for easy login,signup and even password resets using Nodemailer and Brevo SMTP system. It uses the basic JWT Authentication system wherein a token is issued and valid until expiry. In my later projectssuch as DM Sales i have implemented Access Refresh token system which is considered modern and better performant for 2025 standards.*

#### Product Filtering & Aggregation
*Through UBIKZ i have triend to implement a simple yet efficient Node JS 18 standard filtering,sorting,paginating & limiting system that allows both users and admin team to categorize products for easy access and functionality also i have attached an aggregation process that allows to extract top 5 products using the MONGO DB AGGREGATION pipeline also category wise stats. The code can be accessed from within the UTILS folder with the APIFeatures class that is a JS class based implementation to easily implement the operations using custom object flow*
